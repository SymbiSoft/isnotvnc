# Intro #
isNotVNC is not a heavy-tested-application. A lot of bugs could be in the code. That's my first mobile application.


# Requirements #
A Symbian 3rd edition phone (I have a Nokia E51)


# Installation #

Install Pys60 (http://wiki.opensource.nokia.com/projects/PyS60) and PythonScriptShell.

Download PythonScriptShell **unsigned testrange** (you have to sign it with ALL capabilities).
You can use https://www.symbiansigned.com for that.
Install the signed package on your phone.

Someway create e:\Python and e:\Python\lib dirs on your phone.

Download keypress **unsigned** (http://wiki.forum.nokia.com/index.php/How_to_simulate_a_keypress_in_PyS60) and do the same as for PythonScriptShell.

Copy isNotVNC-Phone.py on your phone.

Run the java program on your PC:

java -jar isNotVNC.jar

On your phone run script from PythonScriptShell and select the isNotVNC-Phone.py script. The GUI will ask you to connect to your PC / service.

Enjoy!!
